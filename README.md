# CS50P

## Introduction to Programming with Python (edX, Harvard)

### Overview
An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how to 
read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed for 
students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to learn 
Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return values (oh 
my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean expressions; and loops. 
Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix bugs, and write unit tests; use 
third-party libraries; validate and extract data with regular expressions; 
model real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties; and 
read and write files. Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises 
inspired by real-world programming problems. No software required except for a 
web browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

### Objectives
Students who take CS50P learn:
- functions, variables
- conditionals
- loops
- exceptions
- libraries
- unit tests
- file i/o
- regular expressions
- object-oriented programming

### Projects
CS50P includes ten lectures, each of which includes a problem set, except for 
the final lecture when a final project is assigned. The problem sets require 
students to apply the topics covered during the lectures in one or more 
projects. The project's instructions (I) and repository files (R) can be
